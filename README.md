# 7_Days-Hackathon

The first day of the **Marketplace Builder Hackathon** was dedicated to brainstorming and conceptualizing **Bandage**, an e-commerce platform focused on vibrant, affordable summer fashion. Leveraging my background in **Mathematics and Economics**, I laid the groundwork for key components of the platform, including:

- Curating a modern, lightweight summer collection.
- Designing an efficient database schema for customer, order, and delivery management.
- Committing to accessibility and eco-friendly practices in fashion offerings.

This initial phase allows for a strong foundation that blends analytical insights with creative design. Excited for what comes next!
